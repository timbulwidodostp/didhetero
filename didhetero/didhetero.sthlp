{title:Description}

{pstd}
The {cmd:didhetero} package implements the doubly robust estimator for
group-time conditional average treatment effects on the treated (CATT)
proposed by Imai, Qin, and Yanagi (2025). It extends the Callaway and
Sant'Anna (2021) staggered difference-in-differences framework to accommodate
treatment effect heterogeneity driven by a continuous pre-treatment
covariate {it:z}.

{pstd}
The estimator combines inverse probability weighting with outcome regression
through local polynomial smoothing and reports both pointwise and uniform
confidence bands. Uniform bands are obtained via an analytical distributional
approximation and a multiplier bootstrap procedure.

{pstd}
The {cmd:didhetero} command documented here is the unified entry point for
the package. It shares the estimation engine and option interface of
{helpb catt_gt}; the two commands are interchangeable for estimation and
differ only in legacy naming conventions for the boolean toggles. After
estimation, use {helpb aggte_gt} to aggregate the CATT surface into summary
parameters and {helpb catt_gt_graph} to plot the results.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Required}

{phang}
{opth id(varname)} specifies the variable that identifies individual panel
units. Each unit must appear in every time period (balanced panel required).

{phang}
{opth time(varname)} specifies the time period variable. Must contain integer
values.

{phang}
{opth group(varname)} specifies the treatment group variable, defined as the
first period in which a unit receives treatment. Units with {cmd:group = 0} are
never-treated. Must be time-invariant within each {opt id()}.

{phang}
{opth z(varname)} specifies the continuous pre-treatment covariate along which
treatment effect heterogeneity is estimated. Must be time-invariant within each
{opt id()}.

{phang}
{opt zeval(numlist)} specifies the evaluation points at which the CATT function
is estimated. These should lie within the support of {it:z}. The command sorts
{opt zeval()} into ascending order before estimation, and both {cmd:e(zeval)}
and the rows of the reported results table / {cmd:e(results)} are returned in
that ascending-order {it:z} layout rather than the raw input order.

{dlgtab:Covariates}

{phang}
{opt xformula(string)} specifies the {it:complete} covariate set for the
first-stage outcome regression and the generalized propensity score.
When {opt xformula()} is omitted, the design matrix defaults to
{it:X} = [1, {it:z}]. Once specified, {opt xformula()} fully replaces the
default set. A variable list or formula with an intercept (e.g.,
{cmd:xformula(Z)}, {cmd:xformula("~ Z + X1")}) produces
{it:X} = [1, columns given in xformula]. An explicit no-intercept formula
(e.g., {cmd:xformula("~ 0 + Z")} or {cmd:xformula("~ Z - 1")}) suppresses
the constant column.
{opt xformula()} must explicitly include {it:z} (e.g., {cmd:xformula(Z)});
otherwise the command exits with an error.
To add extra covariates, ensure they exist in the dataset and list them
together with {cmd:Z} in {opt xformula()}.
As with {opt z()}, every covariate in {opt xformula()} must be time-invariant
within each {opt id()} (pre-treatment covariates {it:X_i} in the paper);
time-varying variables cause an error.
Supported syntax includes bare variables, {cmd:I(expr)}, {cmd::} (interaction
only), {cmd:*} (main effects plus interaction), and the no-intercept tokens
{cmd:0 +} / {cmd:- 1}. General term removal beyond {cmd:- 1} is not supported.
For example, {cmd:xformula("Z*X1")} is equivalent to
{cmd:xformula("Z + X1 + Z:X1")}; {cmd:*} expands into main effects and
interactions. To include only the interaction term itself, write
{cmd:xformula("Z + Z:X1")}; {cmd::} adds the interaction without
automatically appending the right-hand-side main effect.
When {opt xformula()} is omitted the default {it:X} = [1, {it:z}] is a
convenience entry point. To match the full specification in the paper,
explicitly write {cmd:xformula(Z)} or a more general formula.

{dlgtab:Estimation}

{phang}
{opt porder(#)} sets the order of the local polynomial regression. Must be 1
(local linear) or 2 (local quadratic). Default is {cmd:2}.

{phang}
{opt kernel(string)} specifies the kernel function for local polynomial
smoothing. Options are {cmd:gau} (Gaussian) and {cmd:epa} (Epanechnikov).
Default is {cmd:gau}.

{phang}
{opt bwselect(string)} specifies the bandwidth selection method. Options are
{cmd:IMSE1}, {cmd:IMSE2}, {cmd:US1}, and {cmd:manual}. Default is {cmd:IMSE1}.
When {cmd:manual} is specified, the {opt bw()} option must also be provided.

{phang}
{opt bw(numlist)} specifies manual bandwidth value(s) and is valid only when
{cmd:bwselect(manual)}. All values must be positive. A scalar {opt bw()} is
always accepted. A vector {opt bw()} is accepted only when {opt gteval()}
is supplied, in which case its length must equal the number of specified
(g,t) pairs. When {opt gteval()} is omitted, {cmd:didhetero} builds the
full evaluation set automatically and only a scalar {opt bw()} is supported
at the public interface.

{dlgtab:Inference}

{phang}
{opt level(#)} sets the confidence level for confidence intervals. Must
be between 10 and 99.99. Default is the current Stata global setting
{cmd:c(level)}, which is typically 95.

{phang}
{opt alp(#)} sets the significance level for confidence intervals. Must be
strictly between 0 and 1. This option is retained for backward
compatibility; the preferred syntax is {cmd:level()}. If both are specified,
{cmd:alp()} takes precedence.

{phang}
{opt bstrap(true|false)} toggles the multiplier bootstrap for uniform
inference. Bootstrap is enabled by default; omit the option or pass
{cmd:bstrap(true)} to keep it on, and {cmd:bstrap(false)} to disable it.

{phang}
{opt biters(#)} sets the number of bootstrap iterations. Default is
{cmd:1000}. Must be a positive integer when the bootstrap is enabled.

{phang}
{opt seed(#)} sets the Stata RNG seed immediately before the bootstrap
weights are drawn. The default {cmd:seed(-1)} is a sentinel that leaves the
current RNG state unchanged; the effective seed is recorded in
{cmd:e(seed_request)} and {cmd:e(seed)}.

{phang}
{opt uniformall(true|false)} toggles joint uniform inference over
(g,t,z). The default {cmd:uniformall(true)} produces a single critical
value that covers every evaluated (g,t) pair and every {it:z} grid point
simultaneously. {cmd:uniformall(false)} narrows coverage to bands that are
uniform over {it:z} within each (g,t) pair.

{dlgtab:Panel}

{phang}
{opt gteval(numlist)} specifies the (g,t) pairs to evaluate. The numlist
must contain an even number of values in the format
{it:g1 t1 g2 t2 ...}. When omitted, {cmd:didhetero} evaluates every
identifiable (g,t) pair implied by the sample support,
{opt control_group()}, and {opt anticipation()}.

{phang}
{opt control_group(string)} selects the comparison group.
{cmd:notyettreated} uses units not yet treated by period {it:t} as
controls. {cmd:nevertreated} uses only never-treated units (group = 0)
and requires at least one such unit in the sample. Default is
{cmd:notyettreated}.

{phang}
{opt anticipation(#)} specifies the number of periods before treatment
in which units may anticipate the intervention. The excluded long-
difference baseline is period t = g - anticipation - 1; this reduces to
event_time = -1 when {cmd:anticipation(0)}. Default is {cmd:0}.

{phang}
{opt pretrend} includes pre-treatment periods in the estimation so that
CATT estimates can be plotted against a zero reference line for visual
pre-trends diagnostics. Only applicable when {opt gteval()} is omitted,
because an explicit {opt gteval()} already fixes the evaluation pairs.

{dlgtab:Legacy flags}

{phang}
{opt bstrap}, {opt nobootstrap}, and {opt nouniformall} are legacy bare-flag
aliases for {cmd:bstrap(true)}, {cmd:bstrap(false)}, and
{cmd:uniformall(false)} respectively. They are retained for backward
compatibility with earlier versions of the package. Do not combine a
legacy flag with the corresponding {cmd:true|false} form.

{dlgtab:Diagnostics}

{phang}
{opt verbose} enables diagnostic output during estimation. When specified,
the command prints GPS convergence information, bandwidth selection details,
and progress messages for each (g,t) pair. Default is off.

{phang}
{opt gpsstrict} forces the command to exit with an error when the GPS
model fails to converge. By default, GPS non-convergence produces a warning
and estimation continues using the last-iteration coefficients, which may
be unreliable. Specifying {opt gpsstrict} is useful for diagnosing data
issues such as complete or quasi-separation in treatment assignment.

{phang}
{opt kdetrim} enables trimming of evaluation points at the boundary of
the covariate support where kernel density estimates are extremely low.
When enabled, the standard errors and confidence intervals for evaluation
points with near-zero density are set to missing rather than reporting
unreliable estimates driven by sparse data.

{phang}
{opt gpstrim(# #)} specifies lower and upper bounds for GPS trimming.
    Values must satisfy 0 < lower < upper < 1. When specified, GPS values
    outside [lower, upper] are truncated to the boundary. This enforces the
    overlap condition (Assumption 3) numerically. Default is no trimming.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt rbc} enables Simple Robust Bias-Corrected inference. Uses the
    IMSE-optimal bandwidth for local linear regression (p=1) to estimate
    CATT via local quadratic regression (p=2). This implements the recommended
    inference strategy from Section 3.3 of Imai, Qin, and Yanagi (2025).
    Cannot be combined with {opt bw()} or {opt bwselect(manual)}.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt undersmooth} automatically adjusts the selected bandwidth to
    satisfy the undersmoothing condition (Assumption 4(iii)). If the IMSE
    bandwidth exceeds the theoretical range [C*n^(-0.49), C*n^(-0.12)],
    it is clamped to the nearest boundary. Adjustment details are reported.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt profile} displays a performance profile showing computation
    time for each estimation stage (GPS/OR, bandwidth selection, CATT,
    SE/UCB, bootstrap).{p_end}


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
Identification follows Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) under a conditional
parallel trends assumption; heterogeneity in the continuous covariate
{it:z} is identified nonparametrically by the three-stage construction of
Imai, Qin, and Yanagi (2025). The first stage fits the generalized
propensity score and outcome regression parametrically; the second and
third stages estimate the doubly robust influence function and the CATT
surface by local polynomial regression. The covariate vector X used in
the first stage is controlled by {opt xformula()}; pass {cmd:xformula(Z)}
to match the default specification {it:X} = [1, {it:z}] explicitly.

{pstd}
{cmd:didhetero} and {helpb catt_gt} share the same estimation engine and
both expose the modern controls {opt gteval()}, {opt seed()}, and
{opt bstrap(true|false)}. {cmd:didhetero} keeps the {opt nobootstrap}
convenience syntax, while {helpb catt_gt} keeps the symmetric
{opt nobstrap} alias. Either command can feed {helpb aggte_gt} for
aggregation and {helpb catt_gt_graph} for visualization.

{pstd}
For persistence with {cmd:estimates store} and {cmd:estimates restore},
{cmd:didhetero} posts a storable {cmd:e(b)} shell and a conformable zero
{cmd:e(V)}. Generic covariance-based postestimation commands such as
{cmd:lincom}, {cmd:test}, and {cmd:testparm} are therefore not a supported
inferential workflow. Use {cmd:e(results)}, {cmd:e(catt_se)}, and the
reported confidence bands for inference.

{pstd}{opt rbc} implements the "Simple RBC" (Robust Bias-Corrected) inference
approach. As shown in Section 3.3 of the reference paper, using the LLR
IMSE-optimal bandwidth h_LL (rate n^{-1/5}) for LQR estimation achieves
automatic bias correction without explicit analytical adjustment. The
resulting estimator is numerically equivalent to bias-corrected LLR but
avoids standard error inflation from bias correction.{p_end}

{pstd}{opt gpstrim()} enforces the overlap condition (Assumption 3) by
preventing GPS values from approaching 0 or 1. The technical variable
R_{g,t} = p/(1-p) becomes numerically unstable when p approaches 1.
Trimming at [0.01, 0.99] bounds R_{g,t} <= 99.{p_end}

{pstd}{opt undersmooth} enforces Assumption 4(iii) which requires
C*n^{-1/2+eps} <= h <= C*n^{-1/9-eps}. The upper bound ensures the
asymptotic bias is dominated by variance (undersmoothing condition),
which is necessary for the extreme value approximation in Theorem 2
to provide valid uniform confidence bands.{p_end}
