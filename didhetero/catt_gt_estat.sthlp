{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:estat overlap} displays descriptive statistics of the Generalized Propensity
Score (GPS) values estimated during {cmd:catt_gt}. This diagnostic helps assess
whether Assumption 2.1 (overlap) is plausible: the GPS should be bounded away
from 0 and 1. Observations with extreme GPS values may indicate overlap
violations that could compromise estimation reliability.

{pstd}
{bf:Important:} {cmd:estat overlap} is a diagnostic display tool, not a formal
statistical test. No p-values or test statistics are produced. The paper does
not provide a formal overlap test statistic.

{pstd}
{cmd:estat pretrend} displays the CATT point estimates and confidence bands for
pre-treatment periods (t < g - anticipation). Under the identifying assumptions,
CATT_{g,t}(z) = 0 for pre-treatment periods. The display flags which (g,t,z)
cells have confidence bands that do not cover zero.

{pstd}
{bf:Important:} {cmd:estat pretrend} is a diagnostic reference only, not a
formal pre-test. The paper explicitly warns against conditioning subsequent
inference on a pre-test outcome (Section 5). Users should jointly report
pre-treatment and post-treatment estimates for transparency.

{phang}
{opt threshold(#)} specifies the boundary threshold for identifying extreme GPS
values. GPS values below {it:#} or above (1 - {it:#}) are flagged as near the
boundary. Default is {cmd:threshold(0.01)}. Must be between 0 and 0.5.

{title:Theoretical basis}

{pstd}
{bf:estat overlap:} Assumption 2.1 in the paper requires that the generalized
propensity score P(G=g|X) is bounded away from 0 and 1. This ensures that
the inverse probability weights used in the doubly-robust estimator remain
well-behaved. When GPS values approach 0 or 1, the corresponding weights
become extreme and estimation becomes unreliable.

{pstd}
{bf:estat pretrend:} Section 5 and the Supplementary Appendix (Eq. S5.1-S5.2)
define the testable implication that CATT_{g,t}(z) = 0 for pre-treatment
periods (t < g - anticipation). However, the paper explicitly states that
this should NOT be used as a formal pre-test for conditioning inference
(see discussion in Section 5). The recommended approach is to jointly display
pre-treatment and post-treatment results.
